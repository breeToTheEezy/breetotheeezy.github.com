    <h2>The Process  🧠</h2>
    <p>
        I utilized the mind-mapping technique to brainstorm.  The process itself made me think hard and allowed me to deeply understand how to establish strong relationships; in fact, it helped me to compose stronger ideas that take into account a variety of other aspects related to the main topic.  The idea that seemed most interesting/promising to pursue was the causes of casualities caused by Global Warming/Natural Disasters which are typically hurricanes, tsunamis, volcanoes, and fires.  This process has definitely lead to specific ideas that I can focus on, such as:
        <ul>
            <li> 👉🏼Ways to Prepare for Natural Disasters (During or After) which include helpful resources for shelter, food, etc.</li>
            <li> 👉🏼Understanding how each natural disaster occurs and how ways to prevent it from happening</li>
        </ul>
