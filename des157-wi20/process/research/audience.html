        <!-- WHAT I LEARNED SECTION -->
        <h2>What I learned 🤔</h2>
       <p>Now with a clearer idea of what I want to do (with reference to sketches done), I'm going to create a storytelling game that informs my users about wildfires and how to prevent them.</p>

        <!-- CONCEPT -->
        <h2>Concept 🃏🕹</h2>
        <p>Through the use of storyboarding, I created a basic outline of what I hope in accomplishing.  While keeping the game simple, it'll help users to focus on the content.  In addition, with the power of choice, the user can do what they wish.  Through this format, I can inform and deliver a deliberative statement to encourage action to take place from start to finish.
