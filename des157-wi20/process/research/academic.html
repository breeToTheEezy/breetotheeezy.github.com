    <h1>Final Project Academic Research: Natural Disasters</h1>

        <!-- PARAGRAPH 1: PHASES FOR PREVENTION & PREPARATION-->
        <p>Natural disasters have drastic effects on the environment so it’s vital to collaborate and organize emergency plans across all community levels whether that be global, national, or local.  Within the publication, Preventing and Mitigating Natural Disasters: Working together for a safer world by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a preparation process is laid out into four phases: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery (6).  Mitigation involves government and how they try to understand what parts of the environment are more susceptible to the creation of natural disasters and developing ways to reduce its impact (6); in addition, tools, training, and relief products are considered throughout this process.  Preparedness involves how the general public is educated on how to recognize and follow the necessary safety protocols (6); in fact, the most effective way to do so is through physical tasks such as drills or particular exercises (7).  With the response phase, this is when effective action comes into play based on the two previous steps (7).  Lastly, the recovery phase is when steps are taken to rebuild affected communities through assessment of construction plans and ways of improvement of said plans for the future (8).</p>
        
        <!-- PARAGRAPH 2: WAYS TO COMBAT HEAT-->
        <p>Other than a general plan of action for natural disasters, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offer a variety of topics for saving and protecting those that face dangerous scenarios.  With summer slowly approaching, their article, Keep Your Cool in Hot Weather! informs individuals of the major factors that influence how fast your body cools down such as high humidity and personal factors.  More specifically and to name a few, they advise to remain in air-conditioned facilities as long as possible, drink plenty of fluids, take cooler showers, and to check the news for weather reports.  Even just heat which appears to be such a small issue can cause heat related illnesses which may even lead to chronic ones or mental illnesses.</p>

        <!-- PARAGRAPH 3: EARTHQUAKE FACTS-->
        <p>In addition, since earthquakes are the number one natural disaster events within California, the International Charter Space and Major Disasters describe how earthquakes come about in the short article, Earthquakes.  They report earthquakes are due in part by the collision of tectonic plates and the current of seismic waves generated and released from the interaction.  Moreover, magnitude and intensity are two ways of determining the size and strength of the earthquake.  This is most troublesome when usually after an earthquake, aftershocks are at play.  Unfortunately, since it’s difficult to predict where earthquakes will occur, the aftermath of such events with the use of satellites provides clear distinction of the areas that need aid the most.  Despite all the  technology to suit our needs, natural disasters are issues that cannot be ignored.</p>
