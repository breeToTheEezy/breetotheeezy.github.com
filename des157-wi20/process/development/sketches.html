        <!-- WHAT I LEARNED SECTION -->
        <h2>What I learned</h2>
       <p>Being able to brainstorm ideas through sketching helps to give me a few themes I can use to achieve and get a head start in  the design process.</p> 

        <!-- REALIZATION #1 -->
        <h2>Realization #1</h2>
        <p>Sketching out my ideas helped me to realize that most of my work consists of graphics and even thought it's essentially not a bad thing, it brought to my attention the idea of working with other mediums; other mediums being photography or videos. Since my primary focus is on the natural disaster, wildfires, presenting real life evidence through pictures will be more engaging due to its realism.</p>

        <!-- REALIZATION #2 -->
        <h2>Realization #2</h2>
        <p>In addition, since my overall message I want to convey is to encourage wildfire prevention, it could be useful to create a game to reinforce this.  Through the physicality of the game itself, this can implicity enforce action to take place to save the green of the world.</p>
